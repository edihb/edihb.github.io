Hi! I'm Maithili. I am currently a Graduate student at UCLA. 
I'm enthusiastic about Machine Learning for problem solving in various application domains. 
I'm interested in human mimicking computational models such as neural networks and would like to study them further in conjunction with their applications in the field of Natural Language Processing.
